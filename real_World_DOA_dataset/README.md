## Introduction to the DOA Estimation Dataset

In the field of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation, the absence of publicly available real-world datasets has been a significant barrier for advancing and validating DOA estimation technologies. Historically, researchers have relied on simulated datasets to train and evaluate their models. To bridge this gap and contribute a practical resource to the community, we have developed a novel DOA estimation dataset gathered under real-world conditions. This dataset was generated in a parking lot scenario where a stationary vehicle, equipped with a TI Cascade Imaging Radar, collected data. The vehicle was stationed to capture signals from a corner reflector placed 15 meters away, encompassing all possible directions. This comprehensive data collection resulted in 195 high-SNR signals representing unique angles of arrival from a single target. To enhance the complexity and usability of the dataset, we superimposed these signals to simulate scenarios with multiple targets. It is important to note that this dataset was specifically curated for testing and demonstrating the efficacy of our network in real-world conditions, and was not used during the training phase. This setup ensures that the dataset serves as a robust tool for accurately assessing the performance of DOA estimation models.
